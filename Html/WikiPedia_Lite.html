        India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a
        country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the
        second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the
        world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the
        southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast

        By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had
        diffused into India from the northwest. ts evidence today is found in
        the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral
        tradition, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.The
        Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western
        regions.By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged
        within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social
        orders unlinked to heredity.

        Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and
        Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.Their collective era was
        suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[38] but also marked by the
        declining status of women,[39] and the incorporation of untouchability
        into an organised system of belief.[g][40] In South India, the Middle
        kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to
        the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.

          By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had
          arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier
          evolved.[26][27][28] The earliest known modern human remains in South
          Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[26] After 6500 BCE, evidence for
          domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent
          structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh
          and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[81] These
          gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[82][81] the
          first urban culture in South Asia,[83] which flourished during
          2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.[84] Centred
          around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and
          Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the
          civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging
          trade.

          During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent
          transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[85]
          The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[86] were
          composed during this period,[87] and historians have analysed these to
          posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic
          Plain.[85] Most historians also consider this period to have
          encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the
          subcontinent from the north-west.[86] The caste system, which created
          a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which
          excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure,
          arose during this period.[88] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological
          evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage
          of political organisation.[85] In South India, a progression to
          sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic
          monuments dating from this period,[89] as well as by nearby traces of
          agri culture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states
          and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had
          consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known
          as the mahajanapadas.[90][91] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to
          non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent
          religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its
          exemplar, Mahavira.[92] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama
          Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the
          middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the
          beginnings of recorded history in India.[93][94][95] In an age of
          increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an
          ideal,[96] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions.
          Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had
          annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[97]
          The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the
          subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now
          thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[98][99] The
          Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and
          determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of
          militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.

          The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by
          regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[108] When Harsha of Kannauj,
          who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE,
          attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler
          of the Deccan.[109] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards,
          he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[109] When the Chalukyas
          attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas
          from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the
          Cholas from still farther south.[109] No ruler of this period was able
          to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their
          core region.[108] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had
          been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were
          accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling
          classes.[110] The caste system consequently began to show regional
          differences.

          In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created
          in the Tamil language.[111] They were imitated all over India and led
          to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern
          languages of the subcontinent.[111] Indian royalty, big and small, and
          the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the
          capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[112] Temple towns
          of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another
          urbanisation.[112] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt
          in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were
          exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand,
          Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and
          Indonesia.[113] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were
          involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative
          as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating
          Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.

          In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim
          rulers,[121] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a
          new generation of Central Asian warriors.[122] The resulting Mughal
          Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead,
          it balanced and pacified them through new administrative
          practices[123][124] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[125]
          leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[126]
          Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar,
          the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed
          through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine
          status.[125] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most
          revenues from agriculture[127] and mandating that taxes be paid in the
          well-regulated silver currency,[128] caused peasants and artisans to
          enter larger markets.[126] The relative peace maintained by the empire
          during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic
          expansion,[126] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary
          forms, textiles, and architecture.[129] Newly coherent social groups
          in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and
          the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule,
          which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition
          and military experience.[130] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule
          gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the
          coasts of southern and eastern India.[130] As the empire
          disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control
          their own affairs.
